# FairWorkforceAI

## Project Overview

FairWorkforceAI is a project dedicated to developing and implementing AI-driven solutions for promoting fairness and mitigating bias in workforce-related processes. This includes considaration of many gaps inside a developer circle, but is not limited to, hiring, performance evaluation, promotion, and resource allocation. The goal is to ensure equitable outcomes for all individuals, regardless of protected attributes, by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and fairness-aware algorithms.

The project aims to:
*   Identify and quantify biases in existing workforce data and AI models.
*   Develop and integrate fairness-enhancing algorithms into predictive models.
*   Provide tools and methodologies for evaluating the fairness of AI systems.
*   Offer insights and recommendations for building a more equitable workplace.


**Project set-up instructions**

01. clone the repository from this command : git clone "URL-OF-THE-REPO"
02. cd FairWorkforceAI
03. npm install --> To install all the dependancies
04. npm run dev:all --> This opens up the project in the localhost-server.

**Steps for open-sourse contributions**
01. fork the repository and host it in your local machine.
02. If you find any issues in the issues section of our gihub-repo page, try to solve them.
03. Review your code after changes using code-rabit for code optimisation.
04. commit changes in your local set-up. push it to forked repository.
05. set-up all pull request and if there are no merge-conflicts and once we review your code commits we will pull you PR.

**FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS WILL BE ADDED**
--> Allowing the developer to contribute to this project --> Open source contribution
--> Developing different set of algorithums to analyse future job market requirements and how developers inside a company adapt to the market.
